# What is NodeZoo

Nodezoo is a search engine for node modules. The full system currently fetches data from NPM, Github and Travis-CI. It is an example of a real-world service built using
Node.js micro-services. Each micro-service is published in its own github repository along with all
of the necessary config to run the system locally or live . The codebase is intended to be used as
an example, and as a starting point for your own projects.
